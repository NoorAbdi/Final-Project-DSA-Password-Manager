# DSA Password Manager

Welcome to the DSA Password Manager repository!

This project serves as a comprehensive Password Manager, designed and implemented using C++. It leverages the robustness of the Caesar Cipher algorithm for encryption and employs linked lists, classes, and data flushing to ensure data security and efficient management.

## Features
- **Encryption**: Utilizes the Caesar Cipher algorithm for robust data encryption.
- **Linked List Implementation**: Employs linked lists for optimized data organization.
- **Class Implementation**: Utilizes classes for structured and organized code.
- **Add, Retrieve, Update, Delete**: Users can add new passwords, retrieve existing ones, update, and delete passwords for various accounts.
- **User Authentication**: Access to the password manager is protected by user authentication (username and master password).

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/password-manager-cpp.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
Copy code
cd password-manager-cpp
```

3. Compile the program:

```bash
Copy code
g++ password_manager.cpp -o password_manager
```

4. Run the password manager:

```bash
Copy code
./password_manager
```
## Usage

- Upon running the program, follow the on-screen instructions to create an account, log in, and manage passwords.
- Use the options provided to add, retrieve, update, or delete passwords for different accounts.
- Generate strong passwords using the password generation feature.
  
## Security Note

- The passwords are encrypted using Caesar Cipher Algorithm. It is advised not to share your master password and to keep it strong and unique.
- This program provides basic encryption for educational purposes and might not be suitable for high-security requirements.
